### Estimation Explanation
I gave each task story points using fibonacci sequence based on difficulty and time I think they I think they will take to complete.

I gave planning class structure a 3 I think it is important to spend a good amount of time planning this as there is complexity in deciding how many classes are required, what they are, what the relationships between them will be and how they will interact with eachother.

Creation of classes like Rubric, Criterion, Student etc I gave a low esitmates as they are plain java classes which dont have much complexity in their functionality and having spent time planning relationships should make creation easier.

I gave creation of the Controller class and its functionality much higher points than creation of plain java classes as there will be more complexity in its methods and therefore will require more testing which needs to be factored in to the estimate. 

Calculations for the Rubric I gave a 5 as I am not yet sure how to calculate the standard deviation and will have to research this before I begin and again this will involve a lot of testing.

Calculations for specific Criterion I have given a lower estimate in comparison to calculations for Rubric as the research will already be completed and hopefully I will be able to reuse some of the functionaility from the previous task.
